# csgo-scripts
This repository contains a bunch of scripts for CS:GO

At the moment, the available scripts are:
- [auto-accept-csgo.py](#auto-accept-csgo)

---

## How to use

To use those scripts just open a terminal on your cloned directory and type:
```python3
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## auto-accept-csgo

This script just looks for the `ACCEPT` button and clicks it.
It's really useful if you have to go do something and you don't have time to wait.

> NOTE: You have to change your game language in the `setup.json` file.
> You can also add new language simply by adding a new line in "auto-accept-images"
